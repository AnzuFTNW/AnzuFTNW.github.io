# [AniList](https://anilist.co/home) Custom CSS
Here I'll collect all my CSS files that I create for [AniList](https://anilist.co/home).<br>
Feel free to use and/or modify any of my CSS.<br>
If you do I'd appreciate it if you credit [me](https://anilist.co/user/Anzu/) either on your profile or in your code.<br>

### I subdivide my css files into three categories:

## 1. [Themes](https://anzuftnw.github.io/anilist-css/themes/)
This category contains fully fledged out css themes that transform an AniList profile.<br>
There are ones that change your profile heavily and some that only slightly enhance the basic AniList experience.

## 2. [Plugins](https://anzuftnw.github.io/anilist-css/plugins/)
This category contains little plugins/addons that offer customizable features.<br>
You should be able to add these to your already existing css/theme without much problems.

## 3. [Snippets](https://anzuftnw.github.io/anilist-css/snippets/)
This category contains random little pieces of code.<br>
Mostly stuff I made for other people.
